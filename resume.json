    "summary": "I'm a French software engineer that lives in Brisbane, Australia. I am 28, speak fluent English and I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from one of the top Computer Engineering schools of France. I am a ruby developer (Ruby on Rails, Grape API...) with strong software and cloud architecture skills, I am anElixir enthusiast (functional programming), and I am also trying to up my skills with front-end technologies like React or Relay. My technology monitoring skills is also much appreciated as I know very well what is going on in our industry. On a personal note, I have played baseball all my life, including one year in California in college (where I injured my shoulder then came back to France to finish my Computer Science studies). I now play competitive Baseball and coach a youth team here in Brisbane for my spare time.",
